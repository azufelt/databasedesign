        <h1>Return & Report</h1>
        <h2>Final Project Presentation</h2>
        <p>
          Return & Report was an idea that came to life by recognizing a real
          need amongst my own, real-world, experiences. As I serve and
          participate in local groups, boards and councils affiliated with The
          Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I realized that our
          group did not have a standard for project planning, tracking and
          various other leadership responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I've spent the last few years being a big supporter of the new
          Gospel Living (Circles) App, I thought it could use some new
          integrations. So, Return & Report is a project management
          application that is focused on integrating into the already existing
          Circles and other Church authenticated sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our test case assumes that a user has already created an account,
          however the queries to create a user are still included, for
          representational purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you go through the inter-active UI you'll see that it is focused
          around a mobile application, however the screens have been widened
          to also include the appropriate CRUD statements.
        </p>
        <h3>UI Index:</h3>
        <p>
          You'll start at the login page, and then you can simply follow the
          form application through to:
          <p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                login ->
              </li>
              <li>
                start planning a project ->
              </li>
              <li>
                add
                new project form ->
              </li>
              <li>
                view project/ add tasks ->
              </li>
              <li>
                create and assign
                project tasks ->
              </li>
              <li>
                view project and available tasks ...
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    From there you
                    can choose to edit the newly created task, or edit the parent
                    project, or continue to add more tasks ->
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If you click on the top
                header "Return & Report" you'll get a view of all projects that this
                user belongs to/ has access to ->
              </li>
              <li>
                from there you can click the < nav arrow and be taken up one layer to where you can view all of the
                  circle groups that the user is a part of. </li> </ul> <h3>Design Rationale:</h3>
                  <p>
                    The rationale for the design was based on the already exisiting UI
                    elements, from within the production Circles App. Beyond that, I
                    wanted to show that a single user can belong to multiple Circles
                    Groups, and each group can have multiple project workspaces, and
                    then within each project there can be several tasks. The tasks can
                    be assigned to someone who becomes the task "owner". The tasks also integrate a status, which could
                    be
                    expounded upon in a production application, for now it is represented within the UI by a
                    green/yellow/red
                    circle. The status is a working table that is referenced when a user selects one of the circle
                    status
                    markers, then the task would use an
                    <pre class="inline">UPDATE</pre> to add the foreign table id as a reference to the project task.
                  </p>
                  <br />

          <h1>Reflect:</h1>
          <p>Over-all I'm extremely happy with where I got with the project. I of course have so much more to learn about how powerful databases are, but I'm off to a really good start, and have an excellent foundational understanding of what it takes to design and build a database. </p>
          <p>Some pieces that I learned and will take with me was the ability to decrease how much data I store in a table, but then join it with another table to actually produce data results or authentication that is needed. This is also a piece I struggled with, because I WANTED to be able to store everything that I needed in a view in one table so I could esily get to all of the things. But that doesn't allow for scalability, good maintenance pracices, as well as can really limit and even further complicate how statistics get drawn from the tables. </p>
          <p>This database design project may be done, but I intend to flesh this out further and take it to production, either with the integrated circles use, or for some other various platforms.</p>
